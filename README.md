## Built

So far, a user on the app can do the following:

1. Make a post requesting a service from those nearby

2. Check the feed for services being requested

3. Start a chat with users asking for a service

4. Share their location by sending a map with a pin on current location

2. Close/Cancel service when done
3. Rate user after service is closed
4. Show ratings on profile view
5. Sign in with Google/Uni email
6. Show that account is verified if logged in with uni email

## Bugs

1. "Scroll up to see new favours" fav is glitchy
2. If location permissions weren't granted feed isn't displayed immediately after they are. App must first restart.
